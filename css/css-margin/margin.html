        <p>This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 200 pixels,
        so its margin will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent (the DIV).
        Given the declared width of 200 pixels, the margin will be 20 pixels on
        all sides.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="width: 100px;">
        <p>This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 100 pixels,
        so its margin will still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent.
        There will, therefore, be half as much margin on this paragraph as that
        on the first paragraph.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="width: 500px;">
         <p>This is a paragraph, and its top margin is 10% the width of its parent element.</p>
