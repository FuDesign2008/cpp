        <p> Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The
            troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.  The ones who
            see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have
            no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with
            them, glorify or vilify them.  About the only thing you can’t do
            is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They
            imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They
            push the human race forward.  Maybe they have to be crazy.  How
            else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit
            in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a
            red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?  We make tools for these
            kinds of people.  While some see them as the crazy ones, we see
            genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can
            change the world, are the ones who do.
